<p>
As a contributing Cloud Solutions Architect within a large-scale business unit transformation program, I owned end-to-end architecture design for a subset of the most complex workloads — from initial assessment through production deployment. The engagement required balancing aggressive migration timelines with architectural integrity, governance compliance, and the long-term platform health of a hybrid Azure estate.
</p>

<p>
The objective extended beyond infrastructure relocation to establishing sustainable cloud architecture foundations for long-term scalability and operational efficiency.

<h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>

<p>
I was one of several Cloud Solutions Architects contributing to a broader business unit migration program. Within that structure, I held full design authority for a defined set of workloads — approximately 12 of the 35+ applications in scope — selected for their architectural complexity, hybrid integration requirements, and modernization potential.
</p>

<p>
For my assigned workloads, I operated as the solution design authority across the full lifecycle: workload assessment, architecture design, stakeholder alignment, governance review, and production go-live. Beyond my direct scope, I also contributed architectural patterns and IaC modules adopted by the wider program team.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conducted workload assessments across architecture, dependencies, and cloud readiness</li>
  <li>Owned workload classification (rehost, replatform, modernize) for assigned applications</li>
  <li>Designed target-state Azure architecture and hybrid connectivity for each workload</li>
  <li>Recommended and justified hosting models (VM, App Service, AKS) based on application characteristics</li>
  <li>Presented architecture designs and migration strategies to business and technology stakeholders</li>
  <li>Aligned designs with enterprise architecture standards and governance guardrails</li>
  <li>Coordinated across security, network, DevOps, and infrastructure teams from design through go-live</li>
  <li>Led TCO analysis and Reserved Instance modelling for assigned applications</li>
  <li>Contributed reusable Terraform modules and pipeline templates adopted across the broader program</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope & Environment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>35+ business-critical applications across the business unit (program total)</li>
  <li>~12 applications directly architected and delivered by me</li>
  <li>250+ virtual machines in scope</li>
  <li>15+ databases migrated or modernized</li>
  <li>Hybrid Azure + on-premises integration with VPN / ExpressRoute connectivity</li>
  <li>Dev / QA / Prod environment segregation across all workloads</li>
  <li>Regulated industry context requiring compliance-aligned governance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hybrid Architecture Design</h2>

<p>
The target architecture adopted a hub-spoke network topology — chosen specifically because the client needed centralized control over hybrid connectivity and security policy while allowing individual spoke environments to scale independently. A flat network model was evaluated and ruled out: it would have simplified initial setup but created unacceptable blast radius risk in a regulated environment with shared on-premises dependencies.
</p>

<blockquote class="signature-quote">
The hub-spoke decision wasn't purely technical. It was the architecture that gave the security and compliance teams enough confidence to approve the programme timeline — without it, we would have faced months of additional review.
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Hub-managed ExpressRoute / VPN gateway for deterministic on-prem latency</li>
  <li>Spoke-level environment isolation across Dev, QA, and Production</li>
  <li>Azure AD integration with enterprise identity and conditional access policies</li>
  <li>RBAC with least-privilege scoping per workload team</li>
  <li>Azure Policy enforcement for guardrail compliance at subscription level</li>
  <li>Centralized Log Analytics and Azure Monitor for unified observability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Workload Migration Strategy</h2>

<p>
Each application was assessed individually rather than applying a blanket approach. The classification drove hosting model selection, and sequencing was designed to deliver early wins on lower-risk rehost workloads while building team containerization capability ahead of the AKS modernization wave.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wave 1 — Rehost (Azure Virtual Machines):</strong> Legacy tightly-coupled workloads with complex on-prem dependencies. Rehosted to minimize risk and hit early migration milestones, with refactoring deferred to a second phase where ROI was clear.</li>
  <li><strong>Wave 2 — Replatform (Azure App Services):</strong> Web and API workloads that could shed infrastructure management overhead without requiring code changes. App Service gave these teams immediate operational benefits — patching, scaling, slot-based deployments — with minimal friction.</li>
  <li><strong>Wave 3 — Modernize (Azure Kubernetes Service):</strong> AKS was reserved for workloads with demonstrated need for elastic scaling and resilience — not applied broadly. Containerization readiness was validated per application before inclusion in this wave. Teams not ready were replatformed first and modernized in a later cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This selective modernization balanced delivery velocity with long-term architectural sustainability.
</p>

<h2>Architectural Patterns Applied</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hub-Spoke Network Architecture:</strong> Chosen over flat topology to enforce security boundaries and give compliance teams a governance control point — critical for regulatory approval velocity.</li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud Pattern:</strong> Enabled controlled integration with on-prem systems during transition, without requiring big-bang decoupling ahead of application readiness.</li>
  <li><strong>Incremental Modernization (Strangler Fig):</strong> Applied to reduce organizational risk. Full rewrites were out of scope; the strangler approach let teams modernize iteratively without disrupting live services.</li>
  <li><strong>Containerized Microservices on AKS:</strong> Used selectively — only where workloads had genuine scaling variability and teams had containerization readiness. Over-applying AKS would have added complexity without commensurate benefit.</li>
  <li><strong>Event-Driven Integration:</strong> Azure Functions and Event Grid replaced point-to-point integrations for async workflows, reducing coupling between migrated and legacy on-prem systems during the transition period.</li>
  <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):</strong> Reusable modules I authored were adopted across the wider program team, eliminating environment drift and reducing provisioning from weeks to hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cloud-Native & Event-Driven Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Event-driven integration using Azure Functions and Event Grid</li>
  <li>Workflow orchestration via Logic Apps</li>
  <li>Managed database services for reliability and automated patching</li>
  <li>Secure configuration and monitoring capabilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>DevOps & Infrastructure Automation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure as Code via Terraform with reusable module library shared across the program</li>
  <li>CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps with automated validation gates and environment promotion</li>
  <li>Pipeline-enforced compliance checks aligned to enterprise security policy</li>
  <li>Deployment frequency uplift from quarterly releases to bi-weekly cadence</li>
  <li>Provisioning time reduced from 3–5 weeks to under 2 hours for equivalent environments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost Engineering & TCO Analysis</h2>

<p>
Cost modelling was embedded into architecture design rather than treated as a post-migration exercise. This was a deliberate choice: bringing financial stakeholders into the design conversation early built executive confidence and avoided the common pattern of cost surprises emerging at cloud bill review.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>5-year CapEx vs OpEx comparison built per application cluster, not at program aggregate level</li>
  <li>Right-sizing recommendations validated against actual workload utilisation profiles</li>
  <li>Reserved Instance strategy applied to stable, predictable workloads — approximately 60% of VMs</li>
  <li>Spot / burstable instances adopted for non-critical Dev and QA environments</li>
  <li>Tagging framework enforced via Azure Policy, enabling application-level cost attribution</li>
  <li>~32% infrastructure cost reduction realised within 6 months of migration completion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Measured Outcomes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure provisioning reduced from 3–5 weeks to under 2 hours</li>
  <li>Deployment frequency improved from quarterly to bi-weekly</li>
  <li>Availability improved from 98% to 99.9%</li>
  <li>Disaster recovery time reduced from 6–8 hours to under 1 hour</li>
  <li>~32% infrastructure cost reduction through right-sizing and Reserved Instance optimisation</li>
  <li>Application-level cost attribution enabled for the first time across the business unit</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Hardest Problem</h2>

<p>
Six weeks into execution, network validation revealed that three applications we had classified for AKS modernization had undocumented dependencies on legacy on-prem message queues with sub-10ms latency requirements — incompatible with the ExpressRoute path under load. Reclassifying them mid-program risked both the delivery timeline and stakeholder confidence.
</p>

<p>
Rather than force the containerization path or slip the schedule, I proposed a pragmatic pivot: replatform these three applications to App Service with VNet integration for the migration wave, and architect a phased decoupling of the on-prem queue dependencies as a follow-on initiative with its own business case. This preserved the migration timeline, avoided a latency SLA breach in production, and gave the business a clear roadmap for completing modernization on a de-risked schedule.
</p>

<blockquote class="signature-quote">
Hybrid network behaviour under realistic load should be validated in sprint zero, not assumed from topology diagrams. Routing and latency surprises don't appear in design reviews — they appear in production.
</blockquote>

<h2>Architectural Trade-Offs</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rehosted legacy tightly-coupled applications:</strong> Accepted short-term architectural debt to reduce migration risk and hit delivery milestones. Refactoring ROI was documented and deferred to a follow-on phase.</li>
  <li><strong>AKS adopted selectively, not broadly:</strong> Containerization complexity without workload readiness creates operational risk. Restricting AKS to proven candidates avoided support burden and team capability gaps.</li>
  <li><strong>Hub-spoke over flat network topology:</strong> Flat topology was simpler and faster to configure. Hub-spoke was chosen because it gave security and compliance teams the control boundaries needed for regulatory sign-off.</li>
  <li><strong>Reclassified three AKS candidates mid-program:</strong> Discovered on-prem latency dependencies incompatible with containerization in the migration window. Replatformed to App Service to protect the timeline and avoid a production SLA breach.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost modelling embedded in design, not post-migration:</strong> Added upfront design effort but eliminated financial surprises and secured executive alignment earlier — shortening governance approval cycles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Validate hybrid network behaviour under load in sprint zero:</strong> Latency and routing assumptions derived from topology diagrams rarely survive contact with real traffic. Testing connectivity and throughput early — before workloads are classified — prevents costly mid-program reclassifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Containerization readiness must be assessed per workload, not assumed:</strong> AKS is operationally powerful but introduces meaningful complexity. Applying it without genuine workload fit and team readiness creates more risk than the operational overhead it replaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Phased modernization reduces both technical and organisational risk:</strong> Sequencing rehost → replatform → modernize gave teams time to build cloud operating capability progressively. Attempting full modernization in a single wave would have exceeded team capacity and increased failure probability.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost modelling during architecture design shortens governance cycles:</strong> Financial stakeholders engaged early become advocates rather than blockers. TCO visibility at design time builds confidence and accelerates approval — particularly in programs with multi-year capital commitments.</li>
  <li><strong>Reusable IaC patterns multiply individual contribution across the program:</strong> Terraform modules authored for my workloads were adopted by peer architects across the program. This is where individual architecture contribution scales beyond direct scope — and it's worth investing in early.</li>
</ul>
