    Hybrid Azure architecture with workload-specific modernization and DevOps automation.

</figure>

<p>
Architected and delivered a business unit–specific migration from on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft Azure using a secure hybrid connectivity model. The solution aligned with the client’s enterprise landing zone and governance standards while enabling scalable application patterns and automated delivery pipelines.
</p>

<p>
This initiative focused not only on infrastructure relocation, but on enabling long-term scalability, DevOps-driven deployment workflows, and improved cost transparency.
</p>

<blockquote class="signature-quote">
Migration speed was balanced with architectural integrity, governance alignment, and long-term scalability.
</blockquote>

<h2>Scope & Environment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>35+ business-critical applications</li>
  <li>250+ virtual machines</li>
  <li>15+ databases</li>
  <li>Hybrid Azure + on-prem integration</li>
  <li>Dev / QA / Prod environment segregation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hybrid Architecture Design</h2>

<p>
The target architecture leveraged a hub-spoke network topology with secure VPN / ExpressRoute connectivity to on-prem systems. The design ensured integration with enterprise identity and compliance guardrails.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Environment isolation across Dev, QA, and Production</li>
  <li>Azure AD integration with enterprise identity</li>
  <li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</li>
  <li>Azure Policy governance enforcement</li>
  <li>Centralized logging and monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p>
This approach enabled secure communication with legacy systems while allowing independent scaling of cloud workloads.
</p>

<h2>Workload Migration Strategy</h2>

<p>
Applications were assessed individually and aligned to the most appropriate Azure hosting model. Migration was executed in phased waves to minimize business disruption.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rehost – Azure Virtual Machines:</strong> Legacy tightly coupled workloads migrated with minimal refactoring to reduce risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Replatform – Azure App Services:</strong> Web and API workloads transitioned to managed runtime services to reduce operational overhead.</li>
  <li><strong>Modernize – Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):</strong> Containerized services requiring elastic scaling and improved resilience.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This selective modernization balanced delivery velocity with long-term architectural sustainability.
</p>

<h2>Cloud-Native & Event-Driven Enhancements</h2>

<p>
To reduce infrastructure management overhead and improve system decoupling, Azure-native services were selectively adopted across applicable workloads:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Event-driven integration using Azure Functions and Event Grid</li>
  <li>Workflow orchestration via Logic Apps</li>
  <li>Managed database services for reliability and automated patching</li>
  <li>Secure configuration and monitoring capabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>
These enhancements improved maintainability while supporting scalable, loosely coupled system design.
</p>

<h2>DevOps & Infrastructure Automation</h2>

<p>
Infrastructure provisioning and application deployment automation were foundational to the transformation.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure as Code using Terraform</li>
  <li>Reusable Terraform modules ensuring environment consistency</li>
  <li>CI/CD pipelines implemented in Azure DevOps</li>
  <li>Automated validation gates and environment promotion workflows</li>
  <li>Reduced manual deployment dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>
Infrastructure provisioning time reduced from several weeks to under two hours.
</p>

<h2>Cost Engineering & TCO Analysis</h2>

<p>
Total Cost of Ownership analysis was conducted for critical workloads using Azure cost modeling tools to support executive decision-making.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>5-year CapEx vs OpEx comparison</li>
  <li>Right-sizing recommendations</li>
  <li>Reserved Instance strategy for stable workloads</li>
  <li>Tagging framework for business unit-level cost visibility</li>
</ul>

<p>
The projected outcome included approximately 20% infrastructure cost reduction and avoidance of hardware refresh investments.
</p>

<h2>Measured Outcomes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure provisioning reduced from 3–5 weeks to under 2 hours</li>
  <li>Deployment frequency improved from quarterly to bi-weekly</li>
  <li>Availability improved from 98% to 99.9%</li>
  <li>Disaster recovery time reduced from 6–8 hours to under 1 hour</li>
  <li>Improved cost transparency at application level</li>
</ul>

<h2>Architectural Trade-Offs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Rehosted legacy systems to minimize migration risk</li>
  <li>Adopted App Services to reduce operational overhead</li>
  <li>Introduced AKS selectively based on scalability requirements</li>
  <li>Executed phased migration to prevent business disruption</li>
  <li>Prioritized early cost modeling to align with financial stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Early hybrid network validation prevents routing and latency issues</li>
  <li>Containerization readiness must be evaluated per workload</li>
  <li>Phased modernization reduces operational and organizational risk</li>
  <li>Cost modeling during design strengthens executive confidence</li>
</ul>
